## Introduction to React v19

React v19 is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It emphasizes component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI components. This project explores its core concepts and features.

## JSX and Rendering Elements

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like code inside JavaScript. In this section, we explore how to render elements using JSX and how React transforms it under the hood.

## Components and Props

Components are the building blocks of React. Here, we learn how to create both functional and class components, and how to pass data between them using props.

## State and Lifecycle

State is an important concept in React for managing dynamic data. This section covers how to use state in class components and introduces lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

## Handling Events

Handling events in React is similar to DOM elements, but with some differences. We’ll explore how to handle user inputs, button clicks, and other events using event handlers in JSX.

## Conditional Rendering

Sometimes, certain parts of the UI need to be displayed based on conditions. This section discusses various ways to implement conditional rendering in React.

## Lists and Keys

Displaying lists of data is common in React applications. Here, we cover how to map through arrays to render lists and the importance of keys for performance optimization.

## Forms

Forms are essential for collecting user input. This section explores how to handle form elements in React, including controlled and uncontrolled components.

## Lifting State Up

When multiple components need to share state, it’s often necessary to lift the state up to a common ancestor. This section explains how to manage shared state across components.

## Composition vs Inheritance

React encourages composition over inheritance for reusing components. We’ll discuss the differences between the two approaches and why composition is preferred in React.

## React Hooks

Hooks provide a way to use state and lifecycle methods in functional components. This section includes:
- `useState` for managing state
- `useEffect` for side effects and lifecycle behavior
- `useContext` for accessing the context API
- `useReducer` for more complex state management
- `useRef` for referencing DOM elements or persisting values
- Custom Hooks for encapsulating reusable logic

## React Router

React Router is used for handling navigation in single-page applications (SPAs). In this section, we’ll explore how to set up routes, navigation, and route parameters.

## Context API

The Context API allows for sharing global data (like themes or user info) without passing props down manually at every level. This section covers how to implement context in a React application.

## Redux

Redux is a popular state management library that helps manage application state in a predictable way. We’ll go over how to set up Redux with React, dispatch actions, and manage reducers.

## Testing in React

Testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability of a React app. This section includes an introduction to testing React components using libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.

## Performance Optimization

Optimizing the performance of a React application is important for a smooth user experience. This section covers topics like memoization, lazy loading, and optimizing rendering with `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`.

## Best Practices

This section provides an overview of React best practices for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code, including coding standards, folder structure, and component organization.
